  title: Custom Clash of Clans API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    A developer-friendly wrapper around the official Clash of Clans API.

    This service focuses on player hero equipment data, including availability and
    cumulative resource (ore) costs per rarity (COMMON, EPIC). Data for ore costs
    is provided via a local catalog and not from the official API.
